# Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

#   When ranges go beyond already observed values, the model tends to predict impossibly high growth rates. 

# In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? 

#   It appears as if all plots contain non-linear relationships, judging by how wildly inaccurate the linear models fit for them. However, I am keenly aware of the possibility that I totally messed something up here... it kind of looks like it.


# Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

# Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

#   # I do not know near enough math to find the appropriate values for this function, however it would look something like this:
#   nl <- read.csv("../../Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")
#   nl %>% ggplot(aes(x=predictor,y=response)) + geom_point()
#   nl_mod1 <- nl %>% nls(data=., predictor ~ SSlogis(response, 4.4, 2.2, 0.266))
